This program in an endless cycle reads commands from the user. After the command user should enter the nucleotide sequence. 

List of commands:
exit — command to finish the program
transcribe — command to output transcribed sequence
reverse — command to output reversed sequence
complement — command to output complement sequence
reverse complement — command to output reversed complement sequence

The program works only with nucleotide sequences and saves the case of characters.
