# Databases homework
In this homework we are exercising in working with SQL databases and `sqlite3` library for python

The task is to create database from files `genstudio.csv` and `metadata.csv` and to make some queries for it.

## Folder structure
`sql_databases.ipynb` - jupiter notebook with code, tests and comments  
`sql_databases.py` - file only with code  
`genstudio.csv` and `metadata.csv` - data for database (in zip archive)
`requirements.txt` - required packages

Before running the script:
1. Put the next command:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

2. Unzip `genstudio.zip` and `metadata.zip`
