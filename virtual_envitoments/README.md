This is my awersome research on virtual environments. The article is available at doi:10.1111/1000-7 
You can easily reproduce my results by running scripts locally.

## How to run the code

### You need:
OS Ubuntu 20.04  
Python 3.9.7

### Downloading files

Create some directory on your computer and put into it files **pain.py** and **requirements.txt**

### Make a virtual enviroment

Put in the terminal next commands:
1. To install virtualenv:  
  
```sudo apt install virtualenv```
  
2. To create and activate virtual enviroment:  
  
```virtualenv venv```  
```. ./venv/bin/activate```

Now you have virtual enviroment where you can run the code

### Running the code

From this directory run next line:

```pip3 instal -r requirements.txt```

Now you are ready to run tha code with command:

```python3 pain.py```

Good luck!
